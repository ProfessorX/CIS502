\frametitle{Concurrency}
A functional program is ready for concurrency without any further
modifications.
\begin{block}{Toy Code in Concurrency}
\begin{verbatim}
String s1 = somewhatLongOperation1();
String s2 = somewhatLongOperation2();
String s3 = concatenate(s1, s2);
\end{verbatim}
\end{block}
As shown above, even if your application is inherently single
threaded, the \textbf{compiler}\footnote{The compiler plays a vital role.} can still optimize
functional programs to run on multiple CPUs.
